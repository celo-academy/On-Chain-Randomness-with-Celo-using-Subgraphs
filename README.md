# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```bash
# Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network alfajores

# Run simulation lottrey club native
npx hardhat run scripts/simulation_native.js --network alfajores

# Run simulation lottrey club stable token
npx hardhat run scripts/simulation_stable.js --network alfajores
```
